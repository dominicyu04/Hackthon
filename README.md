>More time and efforts are needed to collect enough data to feed into the model.<br/>
>Recurrent neural network is very effective to address the challenges in neutral language process and other sequence tests.<br/>
>LSTM is a recurrent neural network model used in the field of deep learning. It can read a sequence input one at a time. It has a cell state that saves the memory contextual information from the previous layers and passes the information to the later layer.<br/>
>A directional model is used in this model. It has the ability to read the contextual information from the both beginning and the end of the text sequence.<br/>
>A embedding layer is added to give a featurized representation of the words because it can show the correlation between words. <br/>
>A dropout layer with a 20% dropout rate is added next to each dense layer to prevent the problem of overfitting.<br/>
